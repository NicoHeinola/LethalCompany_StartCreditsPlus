# StartCreditsPlus
This mod allows you to customize your crew's start credits!

This mod is highly customizable and I recommend using [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) to change the configurations of this mod. If you change the configurations of this mod with it, you don't even have to restart the game!

Host only: Yes. "Clients" don't need to have this mod installed.

#### Epic story moment
I made this mod because all the other mods I tried either didn't have all of the features I wanted or had stupid bugs like not working when the crew was fired.

## Features
All of these can be toggled on/off.

### Static start credits
Change the default amount of start credits.

### Dynamic start credits
The more players join, the more start credits you get!
You can also set minimum and maximum player amounts.

### Random start credits
You can randomize the amount of start credits your crew gets. This ADDS the random amount to the start credits and doesn't replace it. This way it works with other features in this mod and maybe even with other mods.
